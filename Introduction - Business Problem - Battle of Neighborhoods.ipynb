    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to help the people wanting to immigrate to major cities of the world with reseearch on good neighborhoods and ultimately make a smart decision.\n",

    "Essentially this project will provide a detailed infomration of the neighborhoods in a city including the various catergorical venues including yoga centers, coffee shops, restraunts etc. \n",
